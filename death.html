		<h1> The intersection of death, artificial intelligence, and identity</h1>
		<p>Orpheus is a speculative postmortem bot company. I designed an touchpoint for new customer onboarding. The app explores the implications and potential issues that may arise from the popularization of AI. Orpheus is born out of an interest in how technology may be designed with a particular purpose in mind but often takes on a much more complex <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*V_GV1ilPaevQbFvA6Ibozg.jpeg" target="_blank">life of its own</a>.</p>

		<p>Death was never the end of an individual's existence. After death, one still exists in other people’s memories, oral histories, and official records. However, many of us now also exist as huge amounts of personal data, which can be used to derive speech and behavioral patterns.</p>

		<p>In order to explore the potential frictions and awkwardness of creating an AI "alter ego,” I designed an service provider and a touchpoint. Preparing the bot becomes just another step of estate planning. They serve a variety of purposes: to help others with the grieving process, to act as archivists and historians for future generations, or to extend one’s legacy. However, instead of a lawyer, the process is handled by a service provider that creates the bot and manages any and all related data, a mix of funeral services, social media, and tech.</p>

		<p>I intially thought of Orpheus as service to extend one’s life, not unlike cryonics but quickly realized creating a bot is not so much for the individual but for their loved ones and their legacy. Customers should be able to trust Orpheus to respectfully manage their loved one’s data and memory. I positioned Orpheus as secure, respectful, and a touch stoic. To maintain a clear sense of separation between the living a dead, the AI can only be interacted with through a chat interface– a layer of abstraction that maintains distance.</p>

		<p>The idea of becoming a bot is already quite overwhelming and I did not want the visual language to further intimidate users. Flowers were used for the branding as they are often present at funerals of various cultures and denominations and can symbolize life and celebration. A light palette was originally chosen to relieve the anxiety of having to confront one’s mortality, but it felt flighty. Ultimately, I settled on the black and white visuals to minimize distraction. </p>

		<p>As participants interact with the app, I wanted them to consider a variety of questions related to identity and ownership related to technology. Should AIs be modified to create a perfect self? Who owns the AI and any related data? If an individual’s family stops paying for the service, do they disappear?</p>
