	<h1>Exploring mass surveilance and drone policy</h1>
		<p>“We all Scream” is a poster from a speculative mass surveillance future and critiques drone policy, surveillance, policing, and military activities abroad.</p>
		<p>Speculative design is <a href="https://medium.com/a-parede/cheat-sheet-for-a-non-or-less-colonialist-speculative-design-9a6b4ae3c465#.taege64o0" target=“_blank”>criticized</a> for its shortsightedness and ignorance of privilege; designers often explore dystopic futures that already exist in the global south. My intention was to create an artifact that would force viewers to reflect upon not only their own circumstance but also the reality of other distant individuals. </p>

		<p>In the U.S., drone technology lives two very different lives for consumer usage and military usage. Drones exist primarily as a niche hobby for shooting travel vlogs and other adventurous activities. Legal dialogue tends to center on regulating their presence. In the military, drones perform reconnaissance, search and rescue, surveillance, and strike missions. Cruising at high altitudes, UAVs are designed to be invisible for maximum efficacy. The U.S. military insists that drones effectively target enemies of the state, but civilians are caught in the crossfire.</p>

		<p>As I researched the present state of drones, I mapped out characteristics and themes that emerged.</p>
		
		<img src = "img/drone/venn.jpg" class="half margin"><img src = "img/drone/map.jpg" class="half">
		</div>
		<p>I derived more themes from “sight” and toyed with visibility. A drone is meant to be invisible. What would happen if a drone was visible? Why would it want to be visible? Police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, buses, taxis are all meant to visible, as are ice cream trucks. I combined drones with ice cream trucks speculating on what happens when an invisible body became visible. There are strange parallels– ice cream trucks in the U.S. have a very distinct <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZB6WXDuM1g" target=“_blank”>song</a>, as do <a href=“https://soundcloud.com/discrepant/sets/aereal-drone-sounds“ target=“_blank”>drones</a>. They are both, in very different ways, delivery vehicles. </p>

		<p>By combining ice cream trucks and drones, I speculated a future of domestic surveillance drones where local police forces introduce unmanned aerial ice cream vehicles. Drones regularly perform reconnaissance missions on the civilian public and employ ice cream in a bread and circuses distraction to sedate the them into accepting militarized police forces and increased surveillance. Visibility becomes transparency; if you’re not doing anything wrong, you should have nothing to hide. By constantly exposing children to drones, the practice of surveillance is normalized and even associated with something positive.</p>
