		<h1>Interaction design patterns and educational data mining</h1><br>

		<p>i assisted <a href="http://www.peterscupelli.com/" target="_blank">peter scupelli</a> and <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~lelab/?member=paul-salvador-inventado" target="_blank">paul inventado</a> with identifying and implementing design patterns in online learning systems used by k â€“ 8 math students. we focused on a variety of affect values such as frustration, boredom, and gaming, and deconstructed the nuances behind each value (e.g. frustration can be a sign of learning).</p><br>

		<p>online learning systems are becoming more popular, especially for teaching math. however, the learning quality depends greatly on the quality of the content. in this research, we use design patterns as an approach to scale effective templates that educators can use when creating content. </p><br>
		
		<p>data mining is used to extract the design patterns in addition to traditional design pattern development approaches. problems associated with poor learning outcomes are further analyzed, focusing on affect values and student performance. math problems were revised in accordance to design pattern principles and then tested with online experiments to ensure improved learning outcomes. the focus of our group was primarily based on the visualizations used in geometry, statistics, and probability problems. read more about the project <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~lelab/?project=making-math-tutors-more-engaging-and-effective-through-interaction-design-patterns-and-educational-data-mining" target="_blank">here</a></p><br>

		<p>the original control problem, as seen on <a href="https://www.assistments.org/" target="_blank">assisstments</a>, is on the left. the modified version, with corresponding text and image color, consistent images, and more descriptive diagrams is on the right. </p><br>
