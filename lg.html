	<h1>Branding a creative showcase </h1>
		<p>Lunar Gala is a student produced and run fashion show at Carnegie Mellon University featuring student designers, models, and performers.

Later iterations and final imagery consisted of projections on a human forms, visualizing the idea different lives and stories imprinting on one's being. </p>
