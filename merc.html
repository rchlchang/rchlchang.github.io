		<h1> Prompt 1: Increasing Purchasing Volume</h1>
		<p>My initial thought was to go about emphasizing the visuals, looking at what other similar apps are doing for their UI. If an image isn't presented well, users will probably not be interested in buying. </p>

		<p>Yeay (left) sells through video, which take up the entire screen. Depop (right) resembles Instagram. Both emphasize image; buying info (size, price, etc.) is not immediately visible (different screen or scroll down). However, large images ultimately only work if the image is high quality, and that burden falls upon the seller. </p>

		<p>After playing with Mercari a bit, I noticed that users can only buy one item per transaction, unlike a traditional shopping experience, where customers can buy multiple items in one transaction. Especially with online shopping, throwing things into a cart is really easy and we often end up buying more than we initally meant to. By sending directly to payment, users might interpret this as a signal to end their shopping.</p>

		<p>I propose adding a shopping cart, so customers can pay for multiple items in one transaction</p>
