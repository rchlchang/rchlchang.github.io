		<br><p><a href="http://www.alisa-le.com/" target="_blank">alisa</a>, <a href="http://design.cmu.edu/people/undergraduate-student/profile-115" target="_blank">brandon</a>, and i were approached by the <a href="http://breatheproject.org/" target="_blank">breathe project</a> to design a series of materials to educate the general public about air pollution and particulate matter (PM). </p>
		
		<br><p>pittsburgh has a long history of low air quality due to steel plants. while the city has come a long way since the 70s, there is still a lot of work to be done. when asked about air quality, many <a url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinzer">yinzers</a> simply respond that it's been worse in the past. as a result, we chose to target an at risk group: children. by getting children interested and involved, their parents will be as well and motivated to change. </p>
		
		<p><br>the first part was an educational video that visualizes a fairly abstract concept. the video is primarily informational and gives an overview of what PM is and its affects on the body.</p>

		<br><p>the second part, the call to action, is a web based game that children can play on their own or with their parents. the game covers small steps that individuals can take to improve air quality. <!-- play the game prototype <a href="rachelchang.net/img/pm/PM5.swf" target="_none">here</a> --> prototype is in progress.</p>
