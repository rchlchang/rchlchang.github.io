<!-- 	<p>Build Your World with Us</p> -->

	<p>To make technology is to be human.  Fire was not stolen from gods, but fabricated by human hands to serve human needs. While  some may feel we are on the brink of replacement by machine, we are still the makers of fire and machines. We are the creators of our world and the designers of our future. If technology is in control, it is because we have failed to design for the greater good. </p>
	<p>SpinGlass is the force multiplier of human ingenuity.  We are roboticists. We are programmers and designers. We are visionaries and makers. We forge new technologies to serve a greater purpose.</p>
	<p>We inject artificial intelligence where it is needed to make schools and stadiums safer. We build computational engines to support the growth of new waste management processes so that our communities can be cleaner and more sustainable. We build ecommerce tools for healthcare professionals across the world to access high quality medical wear and provide improved patient safety and care.  We use technology to enable the greater good.</p>
	<p>We are a technology company, but we are not a tech company. We build technology not for the sake of building but to transform industries.  we connect the dots when no one else has taken the time to do it - or do it right. 
	At SpinGlass, we work in the world we live in today to build a better world for everyone.</p>
