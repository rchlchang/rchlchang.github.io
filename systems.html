		<h1>An exercise in decoding abstractions and untangling complexity</h1>
		<div class="text col">
			<p> I explored a variety of different methods of visualzing abstract systems. These exercises were then compiled into a single system to create a cohesive experience describing the purpose of each system while also exploring what a system is.</p>

			<p>As the piece is unfolded, the systems grows and becomes more complex. An acetate sheet provides another layer of information of quantified and quantitative self and acts as a "case study" for some of the systems.</p>

			<p>The systems are organized by their interactionsâ€“ one model leads to the creation of another model, one models informs the other. While the unfolding form suggests a linear relationship, each model is connected to others at multiple points; the linear narrative allows users to easily unpack the system and experience. </p>
