		<h1>systems</h1>
		<p><br>an exercise in abstractions, scale and arrangement, deriving meaning, untangling complexity, and decoding value and place. i explored a variety of different methods of visualzing abstract systems to deepen an understanding of different subjects that could potentially introduce and design interventions. these exercises were then compiled into a greater system to be communicated to someone unfamiliar with these ideas.</p>

		<p><br>the unfolding system is comprised of many smaller systems of touch points, social networks, business models, service, modeling man, conversation, persona, method acting, rapid appraisal, and adaptive systems. as the piece is unfolded, the systems grows and becomes more complex. an acetate sheet provides another layer of information of quantified and quantitative self.</p>
		<p><br>the systems are organized by their interactionsâ€“ one model leads to the creation of another model, one models informs the other. while the unfolding form suggests a linear relationship, each model is connected to others at multiple points; the linear narrative allows users to easily unpack the system and experience.  by connecting a variety of smaller systems into a larger one, i was able to uncover deeper connections and see abstractly. </p><br>
