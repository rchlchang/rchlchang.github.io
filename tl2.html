	<h1>Improving client efficiency and transparency</h1>
		
		<p>In the past year I've been working on improving internal efficiency and transparency with a portfolio of B2B clients. This has involved research, production, video and clickable prototypes, code proof of concepts, dashboards. One particular project was a interface refactor that resulted in an 80% decrease in data entry time.

		<h3>Scope and Research</h3>

		<p>To kick off our partnership with the client, I met with leadership and staff, conducted observational studies and ridealongs, and studied internal training documents to understand their processes, relationships, and key business levers. By visualizing their business as a service blueprint, the client and I were able to discuss and identify process optimization opportunities.</p>

		<p>In conversations with leadership, they listed sales person time usage as an area for improvement; cold calling clients vs data entry was eating up more time than they would have liked. Middle management was also stuck reviewing and revising entered data instead of focusing on strategy.(mention account gen)</p> 

		<p> early ideas included utilising OCR engine, but the complexity in the data ontology made it clear it was an excessively labourous task.
		problem wasnt that people were bad at interpreting but that the software interface didn't match the mental models of the invoice or the human. expressed challenged in training staff: they had to interpret documents and data as well as the software interface. Reconcile the discrepencies between the data ontology, the user's mental model, and the software UI.</p>
		
		I conducted an informal UX audit and found that there were usability issues. I backed this up by modified observational key stroke level modeling. Users were excessively (scrolling or whatever)
		

		<h3>Production & Iteration</h3>

		<p>Based on the prior research, I focsed my effort on making all the components and messaging consistent/establishing a design languge and reworking the overall interface to be more compatible with how people actually work. 

		The development team had planned to adopt Ant Design as part of their new development workflow, so I created component guidelines for their specific usage.</p>

		<b>some ui component rules???</b>

		<p>I went through multiple iterations, from most to least drastic changes to accomodate their tolerance for change.</p>


		<h3>Testing & Deployment</h3>

		<p>After rounds of leadership feedback, I conducted (look at bruces book) with the sales team to validate decisions and collect user feedback. (what was something i learned uh)</p>
		<p>After final screens and prototypes were delivered, I continued working with their front end developer to ensure a smooth delivery.
		According to the client feedback, the redesigned interface decreased data entry time by 80%.</p>
